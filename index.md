The 16th workshop of the [PHISCC](phiscc.md) will be held in Beijing, China, on 12&ndash;16 October 2026.

## Motivation

The series of annual PHISCC workshops started in 2009 and aims at bringing together the community interested in HI research with the SKA pathfinders and precursors.
The goal of the PHISCC workshops is to foster collaboration and exchange of ideas both from a scientific and technical point of view, with a strong focus on engaging early-career researchers.

With most major new and upgraded facilities for 21&thinsp;cm research operational, the PHISCC 2026 workshop will focus on the latest HI results in the broader multi-wavelength context and in connection with theory and simulations.
