The 16th workshop of the PHISCC will be held at KIAA, Peking University, Beijing, China, on 12&ndash;16 October 2026.

## Motivation

The series of annual PHISCC workshops started in 2009 and aims at bringing together the community interested in {% include sc-hi.html %} research with the SKA pathfinders and precursors.
The goal of the PHISCC workshops is to foster collaboration and exchange of ideas both from a scientific and technical point of view, with a strong focus on engaging early-career researchers.

With most major new and upgraded facilities for 21&thinsp;cm research operational, the PHISCC 2026 workshop will focus on the latest {% include sc-hi.html %} results in the broader multi-wavelength context and in connection with theory and simulations.

## Important dates

+ 15 Dec 2025: pre-announcement for the important dates.
