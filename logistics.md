## Travel to Beijing

Beijing is a major international hub, served by Beijing Capital International Airport (**PEK**) and Beijing Daxing International Airport (**PKX**). Transports between the airports and Peking University are offered by train (PEK:¥30, PKX:¥40) and taxi (PEK:~¥120, PKX:~¥230). Typically 1.5 hours are needed to reach Peking University from either airport, depending on traffic conditions.

## Transport within Beijing

Subway is the most convenient way to travel within Beijing. The closest subway station to the campus is Peking University East Gate Station (Line 4). From there, it is about a 10-minute walk to KIAA. Taxis and ride-hailing services (e.g., Didi) are also widely available. Shared bikes are another popular option for short-distance travel.
